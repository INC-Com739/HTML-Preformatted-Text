# HTML-Preformatted-Text

Objective
Develop a deeper understanding of HTML elements, focusing on the use of pre-formatted text and its practical applications in web design.

Instructions
This assignment involves creating a new GitHub repository, developing an HTML-only webpage that includes specific elements, and deploying it to GitHub Pages. The emphasis is on correctly using basic HTML elements and the <pre> tag.

Part 1: Setting up the Project
Create a New Repository:

On GitHub, create a new repository named HTML-Preformatted-Text.
Initialize this repository with a README.md file.
Clone your new repository to your local machine.
Part 2: Webpage Development
Develop the HTML Webpage:

Create an index.html file in your repository.
The webpage should include:
An <h1> tag for the main title.
A <main> element containing two <section> elements.
In the first section:
Include a small write-up about what the <pre> element is and why it's used.
Utilize the <pre> tag to show this information in a pre-formatted style.
In the second section:
Display a snippet of JavaScript code first in a regular <p> tag.
Then, show the same JavaScript code inside a <pre> tag to highlight the difference in formatting.
Part 3: Deployment and Submission
Deploy Your Webpage:

Deploy your webpage using GitHub Pages.
Ensure that the live site is accessible.
Submit Your Work:

Submit the URL link to your GitHub repository and the live site as your assignment submission.
